Known issues:
1. Genderless Pokemon are not genderless.
      Just ignore whatever gender it gives you, if the Pokemon is supposed to be Genderless.
2. Some logic is required. 
      (For example, Skrelp is part Poison type, so it comes up in the Western Great Forest, 
      even though there isn't a big body of water there.)
3. Grass types show up in the desert, which is intended. 
      ALL Grass types, not just desert plant ones, show up, which is not intended.
      I may attempt to find a fix for this. Not sure what to do yet.
4. Sometimes a type and rarity combination is nonexistent. 
      (For example: Dragon type with Overpopulated/Common spawn rate.)
      It will throw an error message though ("No suitable Pokemon exist with the randomized type and rarity),
      so don't worry about that too much.
      
My suggestion is generally just re-roll until you get something that works.



Features I'd like to add/fix:
1. Depending on how difficult it is, I will probably add genderless Pokemon in. This is low priority though.
2. I'd like to be able to use the same type/rarity that was rolled and get more Pokemon of that type/rarity.
3. I'd also like to be able to roll the stats (gender, ability, egg moves) of a particular species of Pokemon.
