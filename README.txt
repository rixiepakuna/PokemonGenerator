To use:
1. Make sure index.html and PokeSpawner.js are working and together.
      crawler.html is unnecessary; it is simply the machine that autofilled out the eggmoves for me. You can delete it if you desire. 
2. Open the index.html in a web browser.
3. Select approprite location/time of year.
4. Press the button.
5. Read the instructions that show up explaining how to see your results.
Remember!
- You can always spawn an Overpopulated Pokemon instead of rolling.
- Temp mods are not allowed to spawn Endangered Pokemon. If you are a temp mod and you get one of those, I'm afraid you'll need to roll again.
- Grass types showing up in the desert must be desert-y ones. Like Cacnea.



Known issues:
1. Genderless Pokemon are not genderless.
      Just ignore whatever gender it gives you, if the Pokemon is supposed to be Genderless.
2. Some logic is required. 
      (For example, Skrelp is part Poison type, so it comes up in the Western Great Forest, 
      even though there isn't a big body of water there.)
3. Grass types show up in the desert, which is intended. 
      ALL Grass types, not just desert plant ones, show up, which is not intended.
      I may attempt to find a fix for this. Not sure what to do yet.
4. Sometimes a type and rarity combination is nonexistent. 
      (For example: Dragon type with Overpopulated/Common spawn rate.)
      It will throw an error message though ("No suitable Pokemon exist with the randomized type and rarity),
      so don't worry about that too much.
      
My suggestion is generally just re-roll until you get something that works.



Features I'd like to add/fix:
1. Depending on how difficult it is, I will probably add genderless Pokemon in. This is low priority though.
2. I'd like to be able to use the same type/rarity that was rolled and get more Pokemon of that type/rarity.
3. I'd also like to be able to roll the stats (gender, ability, egg moves) of a particular species of Pokemon.
