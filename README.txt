Tutorial:
1. Make sure index.html and PokeSpawner.js are in the same file.
      Note: crawler.html is unnecessary; it is simply the machine that autofilled out the eggmoves for me. You can delete it if you desire.
2. Open index.html with a web browser (I recommend Chrome).
3. Select approprite location/time of year from the drop-down menus.
4. Press the button that says "Enter".

Remember!
 - You can always spawn an Overpopulated Pokemon instead of rolling.
 - Temp mods are not allowed to spawn Endangered Pokemon. If you are a temp mod and you get one of those, I'm afraid you'll need to roll again.
 - Grass types showing up in the desert must be desert-y ones. Like Cacnea.



Known issues:
 1. Genderless Pokemon are not genderless.
      Just ignore whatever gender it gives you, if the Pokemon is supposed to be Genderless.
 2. Some logic is required.
      (For example, Skrelp is part Poison type, so it comes up in the Western Great Forest, 
      even though there isn't a big body of water there.)
 3. Grass types show up in the desert, which is intended.
      ALL Grass types, not just desert plant ones, show up, which is not intended.
      I may attempt to find a fix for this. Not sure what to do yet.
 4. Bad things happen if the program randomizes that the Pokemon should have 3 egg moves,
      but the Pokemon only has 1 or 2 possible egg moves. A fix is in the works.
      
 My suggestion is generally just re-roll until you get something that works.



Features I'd like to add/fix:
 1. Depending on how difficult it is, I will probably add genderless Pokemon in. This is low priority though.
 2. I'd like to be able to use the same type/rarity that was rolled and get more Pokemon of that type/rarity.
 3. I'd also like to be able to roll the stats (gender, ability, egg moves) of a particular species of Pokemon.
 4. Fix for Known Issue #4.
